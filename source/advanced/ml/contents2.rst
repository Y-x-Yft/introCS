Introduction to ML
----------------------------

Machine Learning (CS229)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This course provides a broad introduction to *machine learning* and *statistical pattern recognition*. 

| Topics include: **supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and adaptive control.**
| The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing.ems.
